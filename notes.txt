ISA - Instruction Set Architecture (x86 && x64)

Basic Concepts :

Registers - Fast and small storage units embedded inside the processors chip.

General Data Registers - These are used to save values from different arithematic and logical operations.

Stack and Frame Pointers - These are used to point to the beginning and end of the stack.

Instruction pointer/Program Counter - These are used to point to the next instruction that are executed by the processor.

The size of virtual address in 32bit is 4 bytes and 8 bytes in 64bit.

Frame Pointer = Top, and Stack Pointer = Bottom > stack

Unconditional jump -  This is a type of instruction that forcefully changes the flow of the execution to another address (without any given condition).

Conditional jump: This is like a logical gate that switches to another branch based on the given condition.

In assembly language, communication with different hardware devices is done through what's called interrupts.

Types of Instructions :

  Data Manipulations --> Arithematic Manipulations, Logic and Bit Manipulations, Shifts and Rotations
  Data Transfers     --> Transfer between memort and registers, Transfer between registers
  Execution of Flow controls --> Jumps or calls, Branches between conditions
